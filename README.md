# LDtk-Room_builder
Creates GameMaker room files from LDtk's json
This app is in a very simple stage, but it can already convert your levels from LDtk to Room files in GameMaker.
To do so you need to already have Rooms in your project with the same names, and also any entities in LDtk also need objects with the same names in your project.
Just select the LDtk file, your GameMaker project file, and click the engine button to build Rooms.
